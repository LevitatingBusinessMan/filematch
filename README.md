# Filematch

A cli program that lets you create a checksum list of all files in a directory, so you can look for changed files at a later time. It also lets you compare 2 directories for changes directly.

### Done
* Creating checklist
* Verifying checklist
* Matching multiple folders against each other

### ToDo
* Verify folder with checklist as lookup
* Make checklists with relative paths (to make the previous possible)

And I still have to split the program into multiple modules
