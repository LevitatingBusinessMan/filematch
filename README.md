# Filematch (temporary name)

A cli program that lets you create a checksum list of all files in a directory, so you can look for changed files at a later time. It also lets you compare 2 directories for changes directly.

### Done
* Creating checklist
* Verifying checklist

### ToDo
* Verify folder with checklist as lookup
* Matching 2 folders against each other

And I still have to split the program into multiple modules
